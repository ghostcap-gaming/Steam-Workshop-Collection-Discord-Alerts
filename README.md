# Workshop-Collection-Discord-Alerts

**Workshop-Collection-Discord-Alerts** is a tool designed to monitor a Steam workshop collection and notify about any changes via Discord webhooks. Initially created for map collections in our community, this tool is now available for everyone to use. It's perfect for keeping players informed about newly added maps, removed maps, and updates within the collection. There may be bugs with using it for anything other than maps, but we've been using it for the past few weeks without any issues.
